# VisualSonificationExploration
##Currently in Alpha
The student will explore how to convert a visual image into a sound picture, by developing and exploring a mapping between different image characteristics (colour, shape, angularity etc.) and different sound characteristics (pitch, volume, instruments etc.). An application will be developed which will allow experimental testing of different mappings.
